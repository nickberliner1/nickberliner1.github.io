        aboutTextOne: "I'm originally from Denver, Colorado but now residing in Northern Italy. I started developing websites for myself and friends and family in high school, just simple sites on WordPress, but got progressively better. ",
        aboutTextTwo: "After high school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I traveled the world. I spent a lot of time in Europe, and then Central America as well. When I returned to the states, I jumped into the startup/tech world. I started an app that failed tremendously, and then began to do marketing which became a full fledged agency. ",
        aboutTextThree: "We did content creation and campaigns for a multitude of companies, including Uber and RedBull, but after awhile I realized I wasn't happy with the 120 hour weeks of paperwork; my passion was in the tech side of it all. I eventually quit the business, and went back to school to get a degree in software engineering.",
